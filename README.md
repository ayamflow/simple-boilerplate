# Simple boilerplate

A simple boilerplate I use for simple sites, tech demos, etc.
When I don't use any JS Framework.

I use Bourbon, Neat, and normalize.scss with a SMACSS approach.
There is both a [Grunt](https://github.com/ayamflow/simple-boilerplate/tree/master) and a [Gulp version](https://github.com/ayamflow/simple-boilerplate/tree/gulp-version).

## Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/ayamflow/simple-boilerplate
npm install
cd sass
bourbon install
neat install
```
and depending on the task runner (grunt or gulp) :
```
[runner] connect
[runner] watch
```
